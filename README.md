# Coding Journal

Coding Journal is a writing platform build on jekyll. This platform is a space for me to learn more about software engineering through journaling and documentation.

Some concepts that are covered include, but are not limited to:

- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Object Oriented Programming
- Dynamic Programming
- System Design
- Many more.. it is a growing list

This repository serves as a facade for the actual source code. Actual source code and platform are hosted separate from this repository. Should you wish to find out more, please reach out to me at my email (gabrielkoh@live.com) or via [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielkohzm).
